# The Lazy Project Documentation

## About Lazy
Lazy is a REST API platform deisgned to make the process of writing REST API's a bit easier, and allowing small scale services
to build out their infrastructure in a shardable way, it achieves this goal by handling Authentication, User Data, Access Control
and Resources for service developers, letting them focus on the actual functionality.

Lazy allows developers to create services that utilize Lazy's internal API to get userdata, ensure users may
access the resource they are trying to, ensure that users have valid authentication tokens, and some more edge functionalities.
